# SQL Problems Collection

This repository includes the sql problems with my solutions and summary. Hope this collection can be of some help for people practicing SQL.


## Introduction

Each problem typically has four parts: 
1. Goal of Query
2. Table Introduction
3. Solution
4. Summary

I would recommend you read the problem first, understand the tables and relationship between tables, and think about solutions first.
My solution is a reference, and Summary is about my methods to solve the problem, my understanding of the SQL function use cases.

Happy Reading!

## Feedback

If you have any suggestions to the collections such as the format of sharing and better solution, I am happy to speak with you.
