## Problem Introduction
Write an SQL query to find for each date, the number of distinct products sold and their names.

The sold-products names for each date should be sorted lexicographically.Â 

Return the result table ordered by sell_date.

## Tables
```
Activities table:
+------------+-------------+
| sell_date  | product     |
+------------+-------------+
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone   |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil      |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask        |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball  |
| 2020-06-01 | Bible       |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask        |
| 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt     |
+------------+-------------+

Result table:
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-shirt |
| 2020-06-01 | 2        | Bible,Pencil                 |
| 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
For 2020-05-30, Sold items were (Headphone, Basketball, T-shirt), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by comma.
For 2020-06-01, Sold items were (Pencil, Bible), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by comma.
For 2020-06-02, Sold item is (Masks), we just return it.
```

## Code
```
SELECT  sell_date,
        COUNT(DISTINCT product) num_sold ,
        GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product SEPARATOR ',') products
FROM Activities 
GROUP BY sell_date
ORDER BY sell_date
```

## Summary
when we need to show all the values of a group in a single cell, group_concat is perfect!
