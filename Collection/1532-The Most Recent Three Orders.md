## Problem Introduction
Write an SQL query to find the most recent 3 orders of each user. If a user ordered less than 3 orders return all of their orders.


## Tables
```
Customers
+-------------+-----------+
| customer_id | name      |
+-------------+-----------+
| 1           | Winston   |
| 2           | Jonathan  |
| 3           | Annabelle |
| 4           | Marwan    |
| 5           | Khaled    |
+-------------+-----------+

Orders
+----------+------------+-------------+------+
| order_id | order_date | customer_id | cost |
+----------+------------+-------------+------+
| 1        | 2020-07-31 | 1           | 30   |
| 2        | 2020-07-30 | 2           | 40   |
| 3        | 2020-07-31 | 3           | 70   |
| 4        | 2020-07-29 | 4           | 100  |
| 5        | 2020-06-10 | 1           | 1010 |
| 6        | 2020-08-01 | 2           | 102  |
| 7        | 2020-08-01 | 3           | 111  |
| 8        | 2020-08-03 | 1           | 99   |
| 9        | 2020-08-07 | 2           | 32   |
| 10       | 2020-07-15 | 1           | 2    |
+----------+------------+-------------+------+

Result table:
+---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
| customer_name | customer_id | order_id | order_date |
+---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
| Annabelle     | 3           | 7        | 2020-08-01 |
| Annabelle     | 3           | 3        | 2020-07-31 |
| Jonathan      | 2           | 9        | 2020-08-07 |
| Jonathan      | 2           | 6        | 2020-08-01 |
| Jonathan      | 2           | 2        | 2020-07-30 |
| Marwan        | 4           | 4        | 2020-07-29 |
| Winston       | 1           | 8        | 2020-08-03 |
| Winston       | 1           | 1        | 2020-07-31 |
| Winston       | 1           | 10       | 2020-07-15 |
+---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
Winston has 4 orders, we discard the order of "2020-06-10" because it is the oldest order.
Annabelle has only 2 orders, we return them.
Jonathan has exactly 3 orders.
Marwan ordered only one time.
We sort the result table by customer_name in ascending order, by customer_id in ascending order and by order_date in descending order in case of a tie.
```

## Code
```
    # TO get most recent 3 orders of each customer
    # 1. sort and mark the orders of each customer by date
    WITH sorted_orders AS(SELECT order_id, order_date, customer_id,
                          ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date DESC) as rnk
                          FROM Orders)

    # 2. select most recent 3 orders by rank of orders by date
    SELECT c.customer_name, c.customer_id, order_id, order_date
    FROM Customers c LEFT JOIN sorted_orders o USING(customer_id)
    WHERE rnk <= 3
    ORDER BY c.customer_name, c.customer_id, o.order_date DESC
```

## Summary
Self-join, user-defined variables methods also work.
