## Problem Introduction
Write an SQL query to find the salaries of the employees after applying taxes.

The tax rate is calculated for each company based on the following criteria:

- 0% If the max salary of any employee in the company is less thanÂ 1000$.
- 24% If the max salary of any employee in the company is in the range [1000, 10000] inclusive.
- 49% If the max salary of any employee in the company is greater than 10000$.

## Tables

Salaries table:
+------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
| company_id | employee_id | employee_name | salary |
+------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
| 1          | 1           | Tony          | 2000   |
| 1          | 2           | Pronub        | 21300  |
| 1          | 3           | Tyrrox        | 10800  |
| 2          | 1           | Pam           | 300    |
| 2          | 7           | Bassem        | 450    |
| 2          | 9           | Hermione      | 700    |
| 3          | 7           | Bocaben       | 100    |
| 3          | 2           | Ognjen        | 2200   |
| 3          | 13          | Nyancat       | 3300   |
| 3          | 15          | Morninngcat   | 7777   |
+------------+-------------+---------------+--------+

Result table:
+------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
| company_id | employee_id | employee_name | salary |
+------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
| 1          | 1           | Tony          | 1020   |
| 1          | 2           | Pronub        | 10863  |
| 1          | 3           | Tyrrox        | 5508   |
| 2          | 1           | Pam           | 300    |
| 2          | 7           | Bassem        | 450    |
| 2          | 9           | Hermione      | 700    |
| 3          | 7           | Bocaben       | 76     |
| 3          | 2           | Ognjen        | 1672   |
| 3          | 13          | Nyancat       | 2508   |
| 3          | 15          | Morninngcat   | 5911   |
+------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
For company 1, Max salary is 21300. Employees in company 1 have taxes = 49%
For company 2, Max salary is 700. Employees in company 2 have taxes = 0%
For company 3, Max salary is 7777. Employees in company 3 have taxes = 24%
The salary after taxes = salary - (taxes percentage / 100) * salary
For example, Salary for Morninngcat (3, 15) after taxes = 7777 - 7777 * (24 / 100) = 7777 - 1866.48 = 5910.52, which is rounded to 5911.
```

## Code
```
    # get the max salary of each company
    WITH company_max AS (
        SELECT company_id, MAX(salary) as company_max_salary
        FROM Salaries
        GROUP BY company_id
    )

    # calculate net income based on differet tax rate
    SELECT s.company_id, employee_id, employee_name,
           (CASE WHEN company_max_salary < 1000 THEN salary
                 WHEN company_max_salary >= 1000 
                      AND company_max_salary <= 10000 THEN ROUND(salary*0.76, 0) 
                 WHEN company_max_salary > 10000 THEN ROUND(salary*0.51, 0)
            END) salary
    FROM Salaries s JOIN company_max USING(company_id)
```
