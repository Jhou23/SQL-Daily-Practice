# Uber Queries III

## Problem Introduction

Write an SQL query to compute the average_ride_distance and average_ride_duration of every 3-month window starting from January - March 2020 to October - December 2020.
Round average_ride_distance and average_ride_duration to the nearest two decimal places.

The average_ride_distance is calculated by summing up the total ride_distance values from the three months and dividing it by 3. 
The average_ride_duration is calculated in a similar way.

SELECT  c1.`month`,

## Summary
Apply JOIN to realize the window function
```
SELECT  c1.`month`,
        ROUND(AVG(IF(ride_distance IS NULL, 0, ride_distance)), 2) average_ride_distance,
        ROUND(AVG(IF(ride_duration IS NULL, 0, ride_duration)), 2) average_ride_duration
FROM cte c1 LEFT JOIN cte c2 
                 ON (c2.`month` BETWEEN c1.`month` AND c1.`month` + 2)
            LEFT JOIN rides_monthly t1 
                 ON (c2.`month` = t1.`month`) 
GROUP BY c1.`month`
HAVING COUNT(c2.`month`) = 3
