By the end of January --> two active drivers (10, 8) and no accepted rides. The percentage is 0%.
By the end of February --> three active drivers (10, 8, 5) and no accepted rides. The percentage is 0%.
By the end of March --> four active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7) and one accepted ride by driver (10). The percentage is (1 / 4) * 100 = 25%.

## Code
```
# Create 2020 month column for final report
WITH RECURSIVE mon AS (
    SELECT 1 m
    UNION ALL 
    SELECT m + 1 FROM mon WHERE m < 12),

# Count the total drivers of each month
driver_by_mon AS (
    SELECT m, COUNT(driver_id) as total_drivers
    FROM mon LEFT JOIN Drivers d 
            # count drivers number joined before each month of 2020
             ON 202000 + mon.m >= DATE_FORMAT(d.join_date, '%Y%m')
    GROUP BY m),

# Count the drivers who accepted orders during each month
active_drivers AS (
    SELECT MONTH(requested_at) as m, 
           COUNT(DISTINCT(driver_id)) as active_drivers
    FROM Rides r JOIN AcceptedRides USING(ride_id)
    WHERE LEFT(requested_at,7) BETWEEN '2020-01' AND '2020-12'
    GROUP BY MONTH(requested_at))

# Calculate the % of active drivers by 2020 month
SELECT d.m AS month, 
       IF(total_drivers = 0, 0, ROUND(IFNULL(active_drivers, 0)/total_drivers*100, 2))
       AS working_percentage
FROM driver_by_mon d LEFT JOIN active_drivers ad USING(m)
```

## Summary
1. Approach: 
  Top down method: working percentage of drivers by month = active driver/ total drivers<br/>
                   get the active drivers by month <br/>
                      -> JOIN "rides" table with "acceptedRides" table <br/>
                      -> filter orders not in 2020 -> group by month<br/>
                   get the total drivers by month  <br/>
                      -> create a full month column for 2020 <br/>
                      -> COUNT all the drivers join before the month to join<br/>
                   divide total drivers by active drivers
                   
2. Trick:  Count total drivers by month
           use GROUP BY  + LEFT JOIN with comparison between date  

           SELECT month, COUNT(driver_id) as total_drivers
           FROM mon LEFT JOIN Drivers d 
           # count drivers number joined before each month of 2020
           ON 202000 + mon.m >= DATE_FORMAT(d.join_date, '%Y%m')
           GROUP BY m
